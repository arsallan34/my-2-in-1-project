    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      The Story of my Life I have a very fulfilling feeling about what I have
      been able to accomplish in my life so far. <br />I want the absolute best
      for myself and those close to me. <br />I often go above and beyond to
      help those around me succeed and be the best version of themselves that
      they can possibly be me. My life is a mixture of moments, some happy
      moments and others not so much, but regardless, these moments have made me
      the person that I am today and I don’t regret anything that had happen. I
      consider myself a strong, and a very determined person, I have dreams to
      fill the world and and be with the one I loved more then everything in my
      life but that did not happen I am willing to do the necessary efforts to
      attain those dreams. My motivations I inherit from my family, more
      specifically my father that I love so much; I have always …show more
      content… The time to breathe before advancing further in my future
      projects, the difficult moments instead of discouraging me, these moments
      give me motivation and the necessary energy to move forward. I am optimist
      but realistic. My parents taught me that we live in a world that is
      constantly changing and to succeed we need a smart plan and the ability to
      adapt and adjust to the changing world environment but more importantly
      one need to prepare myself to succeed. We need discipline and above all an
      unshakable will to resist difficulties when they happen.
